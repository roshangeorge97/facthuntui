i have stored the files, in assignmentfh/src. i have not yet completely designed the site, due to tight submission deadline. But ill be able to make
the site look and feel much smoother, if i have more time. I will be able to create hamburger functionality for navigation, and on hover make each grid change its 
background color. i can also make it responsive to screens, for now i have absolutely positioned everything. this opportunity you would provide me, will give me 
a huge motivation and kickstart to my career. hoping for a positive reply, thankyou!
